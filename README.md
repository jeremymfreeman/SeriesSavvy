# Series Savvy  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
**Series Savvy** is a cross-platform mobile app (built with **Flutter/Dart**) that serves as a social platform for TV show enthusiasts, inspired by Letterboxd.  

This project was developed **independently** as my final project for the **Mobile Application Development** course during my sophomore year at California Baptist University.  

The app combines user-driven social features with external API integration, allowing users to review, rate, and discuss shows while exploring detailed information about series, episodes, and casts.
